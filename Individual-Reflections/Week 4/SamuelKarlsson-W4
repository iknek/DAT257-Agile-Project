What do I want to learn or understand better?
Some of us are still having problems with making Android Studio work, including myself.
As for the Scrum process, I am not sure enough on how we should be communicating with our product owners and shareholders in this project.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By communicating with my team, helping each other with any technical/design problems we are currently facing.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I try to be active in discussions during meetings, trying to add my perspective whenever applicable.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have worked with team 2 on implementing sorting algorithms for the lost items in our program.
This week was not very productive for any of us, since we had holidays for monday and tuesday.
We are expecting to get much more done next sprint.
