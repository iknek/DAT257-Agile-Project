What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to develop a better understanding of how to write high quality code and also document the code I write properly.
I have now gotten comfortable with writing more code on my own to solve certain issues ut to become even more independent.
To help my team mates I want to make sure I write high quality code and make it easy to understand the documentation.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can make sure that we discuss what everyone wants to learn and do during our meetings. Facilitating a conversation on what team
members want to learn will make it easier for everyone to learn new things. Another thing I can do is to make sure to include everyone in team decisions during meetings.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I take active part in meetings and come with suggestions on how to implement scrum efficiently in our work process. I also make sure to bring up when I feel we fail in our application of scrum.
This is important so that we can learn from it and apply it more effectively going forward in sprints. I think the retrospectives have been helpful with this giving everyone a chance to voice their opinion.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have helped my team in delivering the user stories we set out to do. This week that included making sure that the user could add their own categories easily and then add them to items.
I also documented some code we had created earlier to make it easier to understand everything.
