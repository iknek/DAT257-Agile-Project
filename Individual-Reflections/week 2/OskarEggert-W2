Individual reflections - Oskar Eggert

What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to build out my technical understanding and what is required for a commercial software project. 
I want to improve my understanding of agile project processes and see what challenges and benefits there are to the way of working.
I also want to improve my ability to collaborate on a software project in a group where we have different skillsets. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I can include people in tasks where I have knowledge and they don’t allowing them to learn something new. 
This we divided the tasks by previous experience due to being stressed about a deadline in another course. 
Going forward it will probably be better to pair team members together where one teammate has experience and one person gets to learn something new. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

I raised the viewpoint that we should create a scrum board and contributed to setting up the board. 
I have then tried to use it throughout the week. 
It feels like it will be possible to contribute more to the application of scrum next week when the sprints are underway.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

This week I took responsibility for making sure me and my teammates finished the business model canvas and also created a scope description. 
I contributed to both of these deliverables and we were able to deliver it.
