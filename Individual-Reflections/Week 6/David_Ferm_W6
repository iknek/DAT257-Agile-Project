What do I want to learn or understand better?
As in previous weeks I would like to learn android studio. There are loads of small areas which are nice to know, which one only picks up from actually trying to use it.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I feel as though I have helped the team in becoming more comfortable with coding, but also the process of learning how learn new areas in coding. I feel like the latter
is something I can focus on.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of scrum?
This sprint I acted as the scrum master. This meant that I took the role of bringing up points to be discussed during meetings, as well as making sure that everyone got 
a say and could make themselves heard. It was an interesting experience, if I were to do it again I would focus more on what could potentially be approved upon in the 
scrum process. It is easy to be satisfied with the way things are and not strive for betterment.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week I, along with my group, had a focus on creating a feature to add new categories.

Overall learning objective would be to learn the small improvements we could make in the scrum process, as well as learning new areas within android studio.
