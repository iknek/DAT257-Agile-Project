What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to become better at using android studio and especially creating the UI.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
When people seems unsure of what to do, or how to do it, I can try to make sure that someone, me or someone who knows it better explains it. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have been actively participating in the meetings raising my opinions.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I've been a part of the creation of the UI and some logic. I'm new to android studio, but I've tried to learn as much as possible to hopefully become a greater asset next sprint.
