What do I want to learn or understand better?
In this next sprint, I primarily want to learn more about memory/performance managment for the application. Whilst this is not something which is currently planned, I
feel like it would be good to implement in a future sprint, in order to ensure that the app runs well. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think that in the coming sprint, I can help my group keep a higher standard of code, alongside continuing the work that me and Samuel have done on the UI this week.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
This week I've aimed at helping my team keep track of what needs to be done to finish up the user stories that we assigned to this sprint. This has (in part) been 
accomplished by organizing work sessions with my group, communicating with the stakeholder, and also writing up todo's/reminders for any things that need adressing 
code-wise.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I re-designed the UI with Samuel, performed a lot of code-cleanup, began implementing the new UI design, and finished the "add category page", alongside 
helping with any issues the group came across and needed help with.
