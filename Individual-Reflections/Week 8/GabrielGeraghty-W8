What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about scrum and agile development so I can be of use in future projects.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can try to express myself clearly when trying to explain what it is that I have worked on.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I am an active member of the group and always try to clarify things that I find confusing.
This may include breaking down user stories or questioning why certain user stories are included or left out.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I was mainly involved in the user stories relating to making sure that the item page displays the correct category, as well as implementing the search bar.
