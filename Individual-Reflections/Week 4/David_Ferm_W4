What do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to understand how the testing process works for applications which use local data storage.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Now that I feel comfortable using Android studio, I feel like I can help others in the group learn how 
It works and how to create something using it.
