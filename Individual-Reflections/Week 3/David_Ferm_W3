What do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to learn the file management system associated with android studio better, as well as learn how to write effective tests for these kinds of projects.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Seeing as I have had previous experience in java and writing tests and documentation and the such, I believe that I can help others who do not have as much experience 
learn how to do it. Of course I do not have all the answers but I am able to give an explanation and idea about the conventions around writing well documented code.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of scrum?
This week I have acted as a team member and tried to help focus the others in my group to stay on track and focus only on what we had said we would. Not go any further 
then we have to as we can do that later. As well as this I have tried to keep the discussions relevant so that the meetings do not draw out too long.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week I have contributed towards the saving item system. This involves the UI, the actual saving and also testing.

Overall learning objective would be to learn how to write tests for applications that need to be running to test.
