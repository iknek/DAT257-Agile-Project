Individual reflections - Gabriel Geraghty

What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how to work together in a group to create something.
I also want to improve my knowledge of programming and software development.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
At this point, that is hard to tell, since I don't know the extent of my team members' knowledge. However, I will try to help create an environment where cooperation and asking for help is encouraged.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I am still learning how to work with scrum so I can't say for sure, but I believe I have a way of helping the group focus on what's important and clarifying what it is that has been discussed. Hopefully this will make it easier for people to understand the sprint goals.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
So far I have participated in the discussion regarding what the social contract should include. Moving forward I hope to be an active team member who does my share of the work and is constructive during meetings.
