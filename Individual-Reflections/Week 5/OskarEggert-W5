What do I want to learn or understand better?
I feel like I have been gaining a better understanding of how the backend and Java works, but would like to improve my knowledge of working with the UI.
Next sprint I will try to do more work on the XML file in Android Studios to become better at working on the UI.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I feel like the biggest problem we had this week was structuring how we were going to work during the week so I think I can help by creating an environment where we have the time to learn new things.
This can be done by planning out the week in a more detailed manner for example.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
During the week I was appointed as Scrum Master and in that role I lead the standup and sprint review meeting. To make sure they were good and effective meetings I set agendas and made sure to send out reminders.
I believe this helped the team in applying scrum practices this week as I helped them to do it.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I contributed less than I ideally would have wanted to. My smaller subset of the team was tasked with a few user stories and we only managed to finish one out of three.
This was due to us struggling with the first user story and not having time for more user stories. I contributed to working on a way to remove items from our recyclerViewer.
This week I also contributed towards running the meetings which took some time and does not show up in the deliveries necessarily but contributes to the team working more efficiently.
