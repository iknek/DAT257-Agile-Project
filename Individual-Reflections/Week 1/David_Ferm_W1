What do I want to learn or understand better?
As it is the beginning of the course I want to get to know the other people in my group better and learn how they work.
This will come with time as we work throughout the course and in meetings etc.
Of course I would like to get a better understanding for how the scrum process works, and potential pitfalls that we will need to work through.
As before, this is a matter of time, once we actually get started on the project we will see what needs to improved upon and what works for us.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Seeing as we have just started the course it is difficult to answer. 
I do not really know what the other people in my group know or potentially need help learning.
This question is also dependent on what we decide to do as a project.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of scrum?
Again, seeing as it is the start of the course there has not been any use of scrum to contribute to.
I was with the group as we decided on the social contract, more then that there has not been anything to do yet.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
See above

Overall learning objective would be to learn the scrum process and create a cool application while learning new skills which are needed for that application.
