What do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to become familiar with the development environment that we are using, as well get a hold on what other intricacies the project will eventually need. This
is so that I can look into them before it needs to be implemented.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As I have not been able to participate this week, I again am not sure what I am able to help other members learn. However I can absolutely help the team with whatever
work is required next week.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of scrum?
This week I unfortunately have not been able to help the team. This is because I am in this years Chalmers-spex and have spent the entire week rehearsing intensely 
towards the production. Obviously this is not ideal, but it was sadly unavoidable. I believe however, that this can be made up for in the future, as other team 
members will also have obstructions and I can help fill that spot when they do.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
See above.

Overall learning objective would be to catch up on what I have missed and to put in extra effort to learn ahead and be able to help the team in the future.
