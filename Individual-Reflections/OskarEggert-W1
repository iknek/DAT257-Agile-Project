Individual reflections - Oskar Eggert

What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want a better understanding of how a software project can be run effectively using agile principles. 
Another thing I want to do is to build something like an application into existence.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Now in the start I think the most important part of this is to come with good ideas for a project which will force us all to learn new things,
both technical skills but also project management skills and collaborating in a big group.


What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
As we are just in the beginning part of the project the most important thing I can do for the team is to build a better understanding for myself.
It will be a lot easier to contribute to our application of scrum if I know how to effectively apply it and understand how it works.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I contributed to the social contract and making sure that we have communication channels and repos for us to be able to do this weeks assignment.
I have also started thinking about potential projects even though I don't have a concrete idea yet.
