Individual reflections - Imad Alihodzic

What do I want to learn or understand better?
I primarily want to get a good understanding of how the agile principles can be applied to a team project, in order to boost our chances of success.
I also want to get a better understanding of how to make large-scale applications that have a useful application. 


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think that I can help with a lot of the technical side of the project, alongside guiding everyone forward to a shared vision. Anything more specific will be reflected
on once we have a baseline idea for what we want to create, and how. 


What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I think that, in these early stages of the application, my goal is to help the team formulate a good plan and process for work, which we can use to get a good start.
I think that a large part of this will come from contributing heavily to brainstorm sessions, thus creating a good roadmap. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Alongside writing the social contract with my group, I've set up a Discord, Slack, and Git repo which we can use to communicate effectively. I also believe I've 
contributed to several key aspects of our future plans.
