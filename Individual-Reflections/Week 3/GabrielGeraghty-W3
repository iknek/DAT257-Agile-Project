Individual reflections - Gabriel Geraghty

What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to improve my knowledge of android studios so I can better contribute to the project moving forward.
I have learned quite a bit this week, but I still feel like I'm not at the level of some of the other team members.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can try to be proactive and learn things on my own so that I can then share my knowledge.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I am an active participant in group discussions and am always trying to keep things on track.
One example of this is pushing for user stories to be divided up further and specifying how the application should work.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I contributed to the UI and some of the code in the Java classes. I was also active in discussing and planning the application.
