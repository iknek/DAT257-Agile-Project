What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since this is the last sprint, and I have learnt most of what I needed to create the app, I can't think of anything I want to learn at this stage. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
In this upcoming period, I think I could help my team to write the report, and more specifically the technical-writing side of it.  

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
During this last sprint, I was the scrum master. Amongst other responsiblities, I lead the meetings, organized future meetings, and generally helped make sure that 
everyone stayed on track and knew what needed to be done.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I helped with the refractoring of the code to fragments, alongside testing the app, and finishing the categories page. I also made UI tweaks.
