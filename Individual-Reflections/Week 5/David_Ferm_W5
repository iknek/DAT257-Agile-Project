What do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to learn how to estimate the correct amount of workload for a sprint. We came to the conclusion that in previous weeks we could have done more user stories,
and so this sprint we decided to over-shoot the amount of user stories. However this week has been especially busy for most people in the group and so it is difficult
to know whether we did not finish all user stories in the sprint backlog due to lack of time, or if it was too many user stories for a normal sprint.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help others in the group with the process of creating an application. Seeing as this sprint I have been focusing on using recyclerViews and Listeners I feel like
I could help others in the group to learn and understand how to make use of them.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of scrum?
Again this week, I have been a team member. I have contributed by working according to our social contract and sprint process, as well as helping the team in the planning
process and reviews.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week I, along with two others in my subgroup, completed the user story for removing items. This took longer than expected due to some problems with on-click listeners.


Overall learning objective would be to learn to find a good balance of workload. I feel as though once we find a sweet spot, we can work more efficiently because we can 
focus only on the user stories we have set out to complete, and yet do as many as possible.
