What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to better understand how to work in Android Studios. I also believe I need to refresh my Java knowledge a bit as it did not come back as easily as I had thought.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can make sure that we all participate in different activities. I can also contribute with good suggestions of what we should work on and sometimes then include new things.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have been actively participating in the scrum meetings this week and shared my opinions. We have all tried to help each other with applying the agile framework using scrum.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We were divided into two groups within the team to focus on different user stories. I unfortunately missed the first work session where my two group partners did a lot of coding.
I tried to make up for this by being available for work sessions at the end of the week where we applied pair programming to help each other learn while programming and also making sure we were doing good job.
I have a lot to learn to get to the same level as some of my team members but will do some self studying over the easter break to be more productive for the team next sprint as I spent a lot of time learning this sprint.
