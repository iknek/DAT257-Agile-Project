What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to become better at planning what to do together with others who are working towards the same goal. I'd like to learn to have "synergy". 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I should learn more about scrum and android myself so that I can contribute to a better conversation and inspire the team.
I can make sure everyones opinions and concerns are heard and considered in a respectful but honest way, so that everyone feels respected and motivated to contribute.    

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have participated in the planning meeting in the start of the week, actual programming sessions, the stand up and the reflection meeting at the end of the week. 
The scrum process was slightly undermined by the short week, our planning was rushed which led us to not really discuss the details of what performance 
measures to use and what our stakeholders wishes were.   

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I've helped to implement the categories with Johannes in the beginning of the week and 
I've worked on the sorting functionality with Gabriel, Johannes and Samuel later in the week. These functionalities were defined in two user stories which are now
almost done. We still have to figure out how to test them our change our DoD.
