What do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to learn more about creating more complex features in Android Studios, as it seems like that will be required of me soon.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think I can be proactive in researching things and trying to understand the problems facing us. That way, I can help others understand too.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I think I am an active member in discussions. This week I missed a meeting so I was a bit outside of the loop initially, but caught up soon enough.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I contributed to the sprint goal of being able to order the items in various ways.
