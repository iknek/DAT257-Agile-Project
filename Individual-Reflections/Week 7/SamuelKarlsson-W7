What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to make sure that I fully understand everyone elses code properly, to avoid conflicts with the code I am contributing with.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Right now I am making sure that everyone is getting everything done, so we can find out if someone needs help with solving a problem they are not able to fix alone.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have helped with coming up with new user stories that would help with getting the project done, aswell as making sure we prioritize properly for the final weeks of development.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have worked with my team with the user stories we have worked on, mainly on the implementation of views for our user interface.
