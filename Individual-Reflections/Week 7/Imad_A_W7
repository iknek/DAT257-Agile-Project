What do I want to learn or understand better?
One thing I want to learn is how scenarios work in Android studio. This is apparently a far superior way of making different views, which we are currently creating 
through the use of app activities. However this is inefficient, and has caused some issues with the bottom bar, which is why I'd like to fix this.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Right now it seems as if everyone is on track and has a good understanding of what they're doing. Once I learn about how scenarios work, I can hopefully help them
understand how they work.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
This week I helped with creating new stories, keeping track of meetings, and organizing work sessions. In the next sprint I will be the scrum master.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I have worked on the category system and bug fixes, as well as working with David on some of the commits that he has pushed.
