What do I want to learn or understand better?
It has come to our attention that the way we have constructed the project is not ideal when using android studio. We have made every screen into its own intent. However,
ideally we would use fragments instead. This would mean that we can certain objects constantly showing, and also spare some memory leak. So that is what I would like to 
learn next sprint, how to use fragments.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As mentioned previously, we will try to figure out how fragments work, and if they are nessecary for the project. I believe this will a collaborative effort where 
everyone in the team helps each other learn how it works.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of scrum?
This week I was back to being a team member. I participated in meetings and did what was set out for our group.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week I contributed with the detailed item view. As well as the removal and editing function.

Overall learning objective would be to learn how to use fragments within android studio.
