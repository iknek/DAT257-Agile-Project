What do I want to learn or understand better?
Similarly to eariler weeks, I want to get better at using Android Studio.
I have gained a basic understanding, so I just want to get more effective in its use.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can make sure to maintain the groups focus during meetings, when we get sidetracked during discussions.
Making sure that we minimize "wasted" time will lets us spend time and energy on more important subjects.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have made sure to contribute in discussions during our meetings.
I have also contributed with added acceptance criteria for user stories.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have mainly contributed towards the UI design/implementation.
Working in both Figma and Android Studio to design a good front end for our application.
