What do I want to learn or understand better?
I still feel like I need to learn a bit more about Android Studios and getting comfortable working with that. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can make sure that everyone is challenged and trying new things in the project. I can also help with planning out the week as it during some meetings
and work sessions have been hard to gather the whole team, if I can help the team show up we get the opportunity to learn more new things.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
As this week was a half week our application of scrum was lacking a few circumstances. It started with the planning session being a bit shorter than maybe it should have been.
This combined with it being a short week made the application of scrum hard this week.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Together with David and Imad I worked on being able to search through a selection of categories. 
I missed out on work session due to miscommunication this week which made my contribution a bit smaller than maybe it should have been.
Next week I will make sure to contribute more and I believe maybe take on some smaller tasks on my own to make sure I contribute.
