What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand how to make the code that I write as good as possible. So far I have been able to implement several features but I have not been so sure that the code has been written in the optimal way.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can make sure to be proactive when it comes to researching how to solve certain problems and then share my knowledge.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I am an active participant in discussions and always give my take on matters like what user stories to complete in what order etc.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This sprint I mainly contributed to the user stories related to adding images to items.
