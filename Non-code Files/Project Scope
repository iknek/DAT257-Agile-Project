We are building an android application that will assist administrators in keeping track of lost and found goods.
The application will allow users to add items to a lost and found register, adding relevant tags.
These entries may include a description of the item, one or several photos of it, where it has been placed, and the user that made the entry.
People who have lost items can then send in requests or simply contact the company which can be matched with the inventory.
