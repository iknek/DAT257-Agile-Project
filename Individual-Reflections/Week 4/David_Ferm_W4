What do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to understand how the testing process works for applications which use local data storage.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Now that I feel comfortable using Android studio, I feel like I can help others in the group learn how 
It works and how to create something using it.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of scrum?
Once again, this week I have been a team member. I have contributed in the team's use of scrum by participating.
I also feel as though I have contributed by trying to keep the meetings as to the point and short as possible,
For example during the stand-up in the middle of the sprint, I tried to redirect the focus to this sprint instead
Of the focus being what we could do next or possible things to do in the future.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week I have helped implement the category selection(when adding items) and category filtering (when viewing)

Overall learning objective for next sprint, is to learn the testing implementation
