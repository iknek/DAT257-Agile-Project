What do I want to learn or understand better?
This was the last sprint so there is not more time to learn or understand something new for this course. Given more time though I wish I could have learnt more about 
assuming the scrum master role. Since we rotated and only got a week to be scurm master it did not seem like a good amount of time to be able to experiment find what works.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
At this point I cannot, I would be able to help in the process of writing the report with the logic and thinking behind our code but otherwise not much to do.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of scrum?
Again this week, I was a team-member. So I contributed by going to the meetings and following our specification and normal process.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week I helped to do some fine adjustments to the project UI and small bugs so that it would be completely finished. I also helped refactor the code to use fargments.

Overall learning objective would be nothing now, the project is nearing the end. For the future I would like to get more familiar with a leader role within the scrum process.
