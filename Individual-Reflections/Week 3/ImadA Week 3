What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to primarily learn how we can ensure that the app works on different devices, regardless of screen size and such.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I'm not really sure. As of now however, it seems I have a better understanding of Java and Android Studio than most of my team, so I hope
to be able to help then whenever possible. 

What is my contribution towards the team's use of scrum?
In this last sprint, I have worked alongside my group to ensure that we get the user stories done. Since this was done fairly quickly, I 
have also made user stories and helped the other team.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
During this week, I have developed the file system primarily, alongside helping my team with any technical issues that they may have. I
have also contributed to the user stories that were designated to my team.
