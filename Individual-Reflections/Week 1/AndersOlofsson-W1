Individual reflections - Anders Olofsson

What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn to collaborate better with others and effectively work on larger software projects.  

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Ï can help teach my team members if there is something I've learned that they struggle with. I can also help by being possitive and contribute to a good learning enviroment. I can help create a safe enviroment to ask questions, and questions that may seem stupid. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Nothing yet. I will focus on following the guidlines and rules of scrum as much as I can when we start with the project later so that we actually learn the scrum process and not just learn about the specifics of the software project.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have disscussed what the specifics of the social contract should be with my team members and agreed on when we will have meetings.
