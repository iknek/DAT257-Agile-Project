What do I want to learn or understand better?
This being the final sprint of the project I have been reflecting on things I want to learn and improve upon until my next project. Before my next project I would like to become better at setting up a new agile team, so that you can hit the ground running.
Included in that I believe is reflecting on agile practices and how to implement them effectively within a team. I think time estimation of user stories and projects is something I would especially like to get better at.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Asking good questions during team meetings and making sure everyone is taking part in the meetings and understanding the team vision and goals. This will facilitate further learning.
I can also encourage team mates to think about and reflect on what they want to learn to create a good environment.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have taken an activee part in all meetings we have had and making sure we try to reflect on our application of scrum. Helping the team to remember meetings and assignments so we can work efficiently.
I have also tried to learn a bit more about agile practices in case there are more activities we can incorporate

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I mainly contributed to working on filtering items by categories and also implementing a new search bar allowing for user to search for items. 
During the week we were split up into groups where we were doing pair programming through screen sharing to work together on user stories.
