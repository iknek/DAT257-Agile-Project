# FindIt
This is a simple android application that allows for users to catalogue and search for items. 

Installation:
To use this app, simply download the apk and launch it on any android device. 

How to use it:
Once the app is launched and installed on a device, you can add categories, which allow you to save items. One can also omit catagories, and add items to a general "All
Categories", which is already set-up. 
After this, the user can add items, which support a description, image, and secondary information. 

Breakdown of contributions: 
Because we worked in pairs and never contributed individually to the git repository, we think that the use of gitinspector would misrepresent our actual contributions.

Branches:
There are two branches in this repo, one branch called "code", for the source code and apk of the application and another branch called "reflections", there you can find individual reflections from team members and information on our project scope and a link to our trello board.
