Individual reflections - Anders Olofsson

What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn to work effectively with many team members. I want to learn how to make an android app.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can bring more effort to the work sessions and contribute more at the meetings. I can share my somewhat limited android skills with the team. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
This week I've participated in the meetings and helped iron out a few question marks regarding how we should cycle the scrum master role and who is our product owner. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have worked on prototyping in figma. I haven't contributed as much as I'd like this week because of fever/illness.
