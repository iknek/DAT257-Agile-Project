What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to get better at working with projects with a practical goal in mind, ending up with making something useful.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By voicing my thoughts and opinions when appropriate, to see if people think differently from me. 
This way, disagreements can come up, leading to arguments which can give insight into a subject.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Since we havent started the project yet, we havent gone far with Scrum. This will naturally change over time. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Similar to the question above. I will try my best to contribute in whatever way is needed to get the project done.
