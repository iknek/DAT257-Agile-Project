- What do I want to learn or understand better?
For the sake of the project, I would like to get a basic understanding of our new workspace, Android Studio.
This will allow me to contribute more to the project down the line.
I would also like to get a better understanding of the scrum process, in order for my working with the
other project members to be more efficient.


- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By communicating with my tram when I learn something noteworthy and niche,
so the others dont have to spend as much time learning this one thing as I did.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have attended meetings and worked with tasks assigned to me by the team.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have contributed by helping with the layout/design of our app in the prototyping program Figma.
