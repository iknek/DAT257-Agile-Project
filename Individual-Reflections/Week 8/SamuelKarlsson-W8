What do I want to learn or understand better?
At this point we are reaching the end of development, so right now there more to be done and less to be learnt.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help out with explaining my implementation of the UI/UX elements for the sake of report writing.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have helped out argumenting over which user stories need to be completed asap, and which ones we dont need to implement for the program to fulfill its intended use.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have helped out with finishing our views, and some minor refactoring of messy code.
