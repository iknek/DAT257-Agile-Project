Individual reflections - Johannes Rorsman

What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn to create something useful for an app in android studio
I want to learn how to split up the tasks in a good way
I want to learn how the sprints really work in practice

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? I think that by being open on the meetings, and make sure everybody are in on the process of what we are about to do, there will always be parts that I’m better at than others that I can explain, and the other way around aswell. When we split up the tasks, I think it will be easier since we could teach each other about our individual tasks. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum? 
Not much yet. Mostly by actively participating in the meetings and helping to set up the project for the sprints to start. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I was involved in the creation of the business model canvas.
