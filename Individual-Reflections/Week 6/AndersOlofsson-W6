What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about reading and writing to files and what the best practices are to do so. I'd like to learn more about how permissions work in android
and what dictates who can access certain files.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help to structure our meetings more by preparing an agenda and separate the discussion from the decision making. 
I think this will make our meetings more effective and rewarding.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have participated in all the discussions and contributed actively with ideas. I invite others to do the same.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I worked to allow for images to be added to items, either via the camera or from the gallery. 
I also worked on a left over user story from last week about the recycler view.
