What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about how to use branches in github and how to merge them together. I'd also like to learn to schedule meetings better so that I am less likely to be late.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can show the non IT guys in our group more specific features of android such as the activity lifecycle. I can encourage them to learn more about programming.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have participated in our sprint meetings and I have formulated user stories for us to process. I have emphasized the importance of sticking to scrum and not deviating to other methods.    

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have worked on a dedicated page for showing the different categories of lost items. This was a user story. I have also worked on, and experimented with different UI styles.
I worked on adding a bottom navigation bar.
