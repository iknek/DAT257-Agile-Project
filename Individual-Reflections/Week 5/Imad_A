What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about how the app can interact with the phones camera. This is one of the big user stories that we are going to tackle in the next sprint, so I'd 
like to have a good understanding of it.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think right now I can primarily help my team to enforce good coding practices, and write effective and clean code. This is something which will help make later additions 
to the program easier, alongside reducing the chance of bugs/issues.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of scrum?
During this last sprint, I have primarily contributed by helping to create the user stories.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
Whilst I have been fairly busy this week with Cortegen, and other personal things, I helped my (sub)group to fullfill the user stories that were assigned to us.
