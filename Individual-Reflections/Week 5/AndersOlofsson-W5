What do I want to learn or understand better?
I'd like to understand the android lifecycle and android specific coding.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can intruduce new ideas for the app and inspire to add more features such as giving it internet access and adding a map which shows where the lost item is stored at the moment or something. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I try to be present and contribute to the discussions and make sure that we don't cut corners with the scrum process. I try to encourage the scrum master to read up on and follow the process.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I helped to refine the recycler view and make it sortable. I'd liked to have contributed more than i did this week, aiming to do some extra work on the weekend to fix the last user story.
