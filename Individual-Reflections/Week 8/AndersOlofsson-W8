What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about how to be a scrum master and lead a team of developers

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can bring some "fika" to the meeting to make others more positive and happy to  study.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Same as always, I contribute and talk on the meetings and do my best to move the userstories around on the scrumboard.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I worked with the user story to implement fragments for the bottom navigation bar and all the assosiated changes.
