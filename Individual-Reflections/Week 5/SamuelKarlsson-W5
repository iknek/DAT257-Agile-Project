What do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to get better at not being late to meetings
I feel like I contribute a certain something once I do arrive, but I am quite aware that my late contributions are still lacking in content for the project's continued progression

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
The same answer as any other week: whenever I encounter a new problem regarding code or emulation of Android software or any other relevant software,
I relay these errors towards the rest of my project partners.
The more experienced team members help me out, while the less experienced group members learn from my poor example

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I bring good snacks and treats whenever I am late to a meeting. Otherwise, I contribute to meetings and conversations the same way as anyone else does,
by bringing up my own unique perspective on interface design whenever my perspective is applicable.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
For this sprint, I have focused most on the visual design of our application. This might be seen as a waste of time in this early of a development process,
but we all agreed that it would be valuable for one of us to consider visual design for later development to follow an agreed upon format. This is what I was
designated for, and despite my lateness in every sense of the word; I always do my best to deliver a good product, even if my product is late.
