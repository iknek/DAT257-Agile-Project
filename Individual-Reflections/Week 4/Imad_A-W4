- What do I want to learn or understand better?
Primarily my goal now is to learn how unit testing works within Android studio and Intellij. This is something which the rest of the group has been
stuck on, and which I have decided to learn. 

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As mentioned above, unit testing is something which the group has not been able to get working, and which hasn't been done. When I understand it 
myself, I'll be able to help the group.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week, I have mainly just contributed towards keeping the Trello page up to date, by moving cards and ticking off the things that have been done.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Together with David, I have done the following: 
- Added better category system. 
- Added catagory spinner.
- Moved code out of main activity class.
- Text field empties on add-button click.
- Program doesn't crash if there are no items in the file manager
I have also started on learning the unit testing software, and preformed general code cleanup + future planning.
