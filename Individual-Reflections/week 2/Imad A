- What do I want to learn or understand better?
With the creation of an Android studio project, my main goal is to get a better understanding of the fundementals of coding for Android in Java. More specifically, I
want to learn the basics such as adding buttons, text, and other elements, alongisde how they can be connected to code. I also want to spend some time refreshing my 
knowledge on design patterns, in order to make a well designed app.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I am going to try and help my group with setting up their projects by importing from Github, alongside helping them to develop my original sketches for the app. I also 
think that I can help them with planning what features we want from the app, and other parts of coding/setting up the project.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
My contribution has been the creating of a Figma and Trello page. I have also contributed to maintaining those pages, and getting my team to plan our next steps more
effectivly.

- what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Asides from creating the above mentioned pages, I have also drawn the original sketch for the application, and create a project (+repository) which we can now begin to
use and work off of.
